# VisualizationFramework-Unity

VisualizationFramework is an effort to make an all encompassing package to deal with projects related to architectural and product visualization, and also customization.

Examples of one-off projects of this nature can be seen on my portfolio here:

Currently the framework has implemented in it white-labeled content offering the ability to build a retail shelving unit in 3D. It is currently in a pre-alha state. A WebGL build of it's current functionality can be seen here:

A video showing the general functionality and method to use the UI can be seen here:

UI functions as so:
- One click highlights.
- Click and drag on highligted object to move it.
- Objects can be drug out of menu.
- Objects can also be clicked on in the menu, then anywhere it can be instantiated in the scene will be outlined in white. Click on a white outlined object to instantiate object.
- Click anywhere in empty space to deselect an item or leave object instantation mode.
- One finger drag in empty space to orbit. Two finger drag in empty space to pan. Two finger pinch to zoom in and out.

Immediate Roadmap:
- Controls fully intended to work with the mouse. Currently it's control are intended for multitouch input.
- More comprehensive orbiting and navigation system.
- Ability to switch object to other 'partner objects' in order to allow more extensive variations of a product.
- Complete overhaul of the UI. Current UI is purely functional and placeholder.
